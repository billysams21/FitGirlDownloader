All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-07-15

### New Features
* **Persistent Download History**: Automatically saves and restores your task queue, progress, and folder groupings across sessions.
* **Grouped Batch Folders**: Replaced the flat table with a collapsible tree view. Downloads are automatically grouped by batch, showing aggregated progress, speed, and ETA for the entire folder.
* **Live Speed & ETAs**: Added a real-time global download speed tracker and estimated time remaining (ETA) for individual files and entire batches.
* **Customizable UI**: Interactive, resizable columns that save their state so your layout is preserved across app restarts.
* **Paste from Clipboard**: Added a dedicated button to paste links safely as unstyled plain text.
* **Task & File Deletion**: Added a "Delete" button and keyboard shortcut support (`Delete`/`Backspace`) to remove tasks, complete with an option to permanently delete associated physical downloaded files.
* **Retry Action**: Added a dedicated "Retry Error" button to quickly restart failed downloads.

### Changes
* **Improved Selection Logic**: Added `Shift/Ctrl+Click` highlighting support and visually moved the selection column to the far left.
* **Extractor Thread Safety**: Fixed race conditions that could cause extraction threads to overlap when multiple batches finish or are loaded from history.
* **UI Polish**: Removed dotted focus boxes when clicking cells for a cleaner, modern look.
